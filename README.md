# HackathonManagement

This is CSC 350 Software Development Class final project. I worked with my team where we have to create a hackathon management system. <br>
In this system, the admin who is the organizer of the hackathon can manage his or her hackathon through our website. This will allow the admin to order food, contact sponsors, and vendors. 
<br>
For the students, or participants, they can search for hackathons, see the status of the hackathon they sign up.
